# Managing your Emotions

Note:
This talk won't be relevant to all of you.

## About me

Note:
I have a sensitive personality. I was peaceful, then I met Mark. It triggered
bad emotions. After a few months I decided I had enough. I looked into how to
control my emotions.

## What's an emotion?

---

* Created by the mind
* Affects the body

Note:
An emotion is the result of your mind on your body.
Emotions arise depending on your mind even when the world around you doesn't
change.
The default state of your body is completely still and neutral (meditation).
An emotion is a transient and accidental state of the body.
Negative emotions like stress can have devastating effects on the body.

---

> You are responsible for your emotions

Note:
No one else but you is responsible for your emotions.
Anger, jealousy, fear only depend on you and not the situation/person. You can't
blame anything/anyone else but you.

---

> You are not the emotion

Note:
When the emotion arises and you identify with it, you react as if you were the
emotion. You lost yourself and the emotion took control of you. You're being
manipulated by it.

---

## How to manage your emotions?

---

> Silent your mind

Note:
Thoughts are of the realm of mind, they strengthen the emotions. Your mind
creates all sort of mental stories that can reinforce the emotion.
Also, don't think about why do you feel this emotion or what triggered it.
That'd only make it worse.

---

> Feel, don't think

Note:
If you don't think, where to focus your attention? Feeling can help you escaping
compulsive thinking. Use your senses, feel your body (body scan in meditation).

---

## Exercise to control<br>a strong emotion

---

### 1. Acknowledge the emotion

Note:
Feel the emotion arising in you. What's its impact on your body?
Be the witness of the emotion. Contemplate it as an external observer.
That's a super important first step, it lessens its power on you.

---

### 2. Relax your body

Note:
Isolate yourself, stop your activity. Make sure there is calm around you for a
moment, while you deal with the emotion. Relax your body, let it go with any
tensions. Take a deep breath.

---

### 3. Feel your senses

Note:
Feel your breath, focus all your attention on the sensations of your body. Pay
attention to your senses. You can close your eyes if it helps at the beginning.
Feel the world around you.

---

### 4. Dis-identify from the emotion

Note:
Feel the emotion inside you. Accept it as a transient and accidental state of
your body. Remember you are not the emotion. Don't act out of it. Don't say
"I'm sad" but "there is sadness in me".

---

## Summary

1. Acknowledge
2. Relax
3. Feel
4. Dis-identify

---

## Conclusion

---

> It works!

Note:
It works at least for me. Impressive results in a matter of days.

---

Positive side effects

Note:
I noticed positive side effects on my attention span and OCD.
I heard that the same technique can be applied to help coping with addictions.
